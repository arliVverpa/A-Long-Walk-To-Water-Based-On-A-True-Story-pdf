Salva is also an eleven-year-old boy who lives in a village in southern Sudan in 1985. He is attending school when his village is attacked by armed rebels. He flees into the bush and becomes separated from his family. He joins a group of other refugees who are walking across the country to find safety. Along the way, he faces many dangers, such as hunger, thirst, disease, wild animals, and enemy soldiers. He also loses many friends and relatives who die or disappear.
     
Salva's journey takes him to Ethiopia, where he stays in a refugee camp for several years. He then has to flee again when the camp is attacked by Ethiopian soldiers. He crosses the Gilo River, where many people drown or are killed by crocodiles. He reaches Kenya, where he stays in another refugee camp for more than a decade. He learns English and gets selected to go to America as part of a resettlement program. He arrives in Rochester, New York, where he is adopted by a family who helps him adjust to his new life.
     
In America, Salva learns about the civil war that has been raging in Sudan for years. He also finds out that his father is still alive and living in a clinic in Sudan. He decides to visit him and reunite with him after many years. He also learns about the water crisis that affects millions of people in Sudan, especially women and children like Nya. He decides to start a project to drill wells and provide clean water to the villages.
     
In 2009, Salva's project reaches Nya's village, where a well is drilled near her school. Nya and her family are overjoyed by the gift of water that will change their lives. She meets Salva, who tells her his story and his mission. She thanks him and calls him her brother.
